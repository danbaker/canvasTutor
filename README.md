This is the repository for the HTML5 Canvas Tutor project.

Concept
---

The canvasTutor will display a single web page that shows the following areas:

1. JavaScript editor  --  
  This is a good ol' normal text area.
  The user can enter JavaScript here to see it work on the canvas.
  Sample canvas drawing commands will be pre-populated here.

2. canvas viewer area (normal sized)  --  
  This area paints what the users code does, in "real size"

3. canvas viewer area (zoomed-in size)  --  
  This area is a zoom-in view of the canvas.
  This area will show all kinds of extra info, including:
  
  * the canvas cursor
  
  * the current canvas path
  
  
  
4. Tutor Control Board
  This area has some special controls that allow the user to learn how the canvas
  operations work, inclusing:
  
  * single-step button -- runs the next canvas operation
    
  * play -- runs all the canvas operations
    
  * play speed -- sets how long to wait between canvas operations when playing
